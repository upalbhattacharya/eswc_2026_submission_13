# Code 

- Converting OWL/RDF files into `polars.DataFrame` datasets is 
  done using scripts in the [process_data](process_data/) directory.
- The implementations of querying OpenAI and open models using `HuggingFace`
  can be found in the `model` directory.
- Scripts for calculating structural metrics and metrics from
  predictions can be found in the `results` directory.
- Mapping metrics to different tasks is handled in the `task_map` directory.
