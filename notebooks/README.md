# Notebooks

Notebooks for generating and visualizing different observed 
results can be found in this directory:
- [make_graphs.ipynb](make_graphs.ipynb) is used to generated all
  graphs presented in the [paper](../paper.pdf) and in the complete
  set of [Tables and Figures](../tables_and_figures.pdf).
- [open_ai_embedding_similarity.ipynb](open_ai_embedding_similarity.ipynb)
  is used to generate the t-SNE visualization of the concept and
  individual label embeddings (Figure 1; Page 12 of 
  [Tables and Figures](../tables_and_figures.pdf)).
- The Correct Retrieval vs. depth and dispersion correlation study
  can be found in [structure_mAP_correlation.ipynb](structure_mAP_correlation.ipynb).
